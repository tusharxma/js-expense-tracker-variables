# js-expense-tracker-variables
A simple console-based JavaScript Expense Tracker project focused on exploring var, let, and const. The goal is to strengthen understanding of variable declarations, scope, hoisting, and best practices in modern JavaScript.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Explore variable **scope** (global, function, block).
- See how **hoisting** affects variable behavior.
- Practice immutability with `const`.
- Learn when to use `let` vs `const` in real-world code.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add expenses with categories (Food, Travel, Entertainment, etc.).
- Calculate total spending.
- View categorized expense breakdown.
- Demonstrates `var` pitfalls (hoisting, redeclaration).
- Refactored version using modern `let` and `const`.
